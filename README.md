# Iâ€™m a digital polymath between sound and web design

Iâ€™m Simone (he/him), a straight to the point hyper-focused person with several major interests, such as audio, development, storytelling.

Unlike the proverbial _jack of all trades_, I truly embrace my eclectic career, and love how it made me fluent in three different fields. Being able to competently juggle between design, web development and sound design, created a constant flow of curiosity and cross-disciplinary interests.
