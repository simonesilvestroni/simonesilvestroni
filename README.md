Under the moniker “Minutes to Midnight”, I help independent artists find their sound.

> Cross-disciplinary professional, I've been working in the audio and web design industries for more than 25 years. Both as a team player or independent, I bring strong attention to details and problem-solving.

🔭 I’m currently working on setting up my **Jekyll** local repository, so that I can handle all my documentation better than I can do through my OS. In the future, I plan to refactor my current WordPress site and migrate everything to Jekyll.
