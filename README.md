# I use [**sound**](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/sound-design/) and [**web technology**](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/web-design/) to turn ideas into an enjoyable experience

Based in Cambridge (UK), Iâ€™m a gen X with a straight to the point  attitude. Gravitating around duality, I use a mix of instinct and  academic learning to juggle between art and technology in equal measure.
