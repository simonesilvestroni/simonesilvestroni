---

Under the moniker “Minutes to Midnight”, I help independent artists find their sound.

**Cross-disciplinary professional**, I've been working in the audio and web design industries for more than 25 years. Both as a team player or independent, I bring strong attention to details and problem-solving.

Currently working on:

- 👨🏻‍💻 Migrating my whole [website, portfolio and blog](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk) from WordPress to **Jekyll**.
- 🎧 My [next concept album](https://music.minutestomidnight.co.uk), titled *The Die is Cast*.
