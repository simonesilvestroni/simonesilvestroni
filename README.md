A gen X with a straight to the point attitude, I use a mix of logic and creativity to juggle between art and technology.

Based in Cambridge, I play bass and design sound under the moniker _Minutes to Midnight_.

In previous lives I used to work as a game audio designer, and a web developer. Today, my day job is with the University of Cambridge.
