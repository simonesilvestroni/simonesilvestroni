# Iâ€™m a digital polymath between sound and web design

Iâ€™m Simone (he/him), a straight to the point hyper-focused person with several major interests, such as audio, development, storytelling.

Started at 16 as a bassist, I learned the craft of audio engineering as a studio assistant during the 1990s. After moving to the big city, Iâ€™ve explored design and programming jobs as a source of income, and was eventually hired as a sound designer for video games, to me the ultimate audio-visual narrative medium. Having managed to make a career out of each passion of mine means being able to competently juggle between different disciplines, which creates a constant flow of curiosity, and a desire for improvement.
